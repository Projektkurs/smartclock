### Steps to create a new widget:
- creating the widget itself 
    - create a new folder in component/components called <component>.dart
    - pasting the widget
        - the widget inherits from Component instead of StatefulWidget
        - gconfig must get linked
        - create a toJson and a fromJson function
            - see clock.dart as an example
        - the state uses ComponentBuild<T> 
        - the return of buildwidget is wrapped into componentbuild
- creating a config 
    - the config goes in component/components
    - if there is no need for a config, use EmptyConfig instead of your own
- updating stringtoType in misc.dart
- updating ComponentEnum in misc.dart
- adding a custom popup
    - creating a custom callback in popups/configmenus
        - use clock_menu.dart as an example
    - adding the callback into popup.dart (currently line 26)
